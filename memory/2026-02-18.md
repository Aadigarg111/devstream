3. **Days 3-10 Features** — Built a massive chunk of the roadmap via sub-agent
   - Added Stats, Repos, Activity, AI Tools, Settings, Search pages
   - Commit: `🚀 Days 3-10: Stats, analytics, AI tools, themes & polish`

4. **"Apple-Level" Redesign** — User demanded ultra-premium quality ($100k website feel)
   - Spawned Senior Frontend Agent to rebuild landing page
   - Result: `app/page.tsx` now has cinematic typography (9xl), sticky scroll storytelling, 3D tilt effects, and a bento grid
   - **Global Polish:** Updated `globals.css` with SF Pro fonts, custom scrollbars, and high-end glassmorphism variables
   - **Dashboard Overhaul:** Completely rewrote `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to match the new aesthetic (removed basic grids, added animated glass cards)
   - **Current Status:** Landing & Dashboard are "Premium". Stats/AI pages pending upgrade to match.

## Pending for Aadi
- ⚠️ Still needs to verify aadileetcode@gmail.com on GitHub settings/emails (commits won't show as green squares without this)
- Needs to create GitHub OAuth App at github.com/settings/developers and put Client ID/Secret in .env.local (DONE)
- Tomorrow's roadmap task: GitHub API integration - fetch user profile & contribution graph (DONE)

## Aadi's Style
- Direct, short messages, mix of Hindi/English
- Wants things done, not explained at length
- IST timezone, active late night / early morning (was on at 10:30 AM IST)
- **High Standards:** Wants "Apple-level" finish, not just functional code.

## Bootstrap
- Haven't completed bootstrap yet (naming, identity setup) — Aadi jumped straight to work
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists, should revisit when Aadi has time

## Session 2026-02-18 (Apple-grade redesign)
- Rebuilt landing page with premium Apple-inspired theme, cinematic typography, glass surfaces, and motion hierarchy.
- Upgraded global design system (buttons, panels, noise texture, typography).
- Redesigned navbar for consistent premium look and responsive behavior.
- Completed bootstrap cleanup by setting IDENTITY.md and removing BOOTSTRAP.md.


## Session 2026-02-18 (Premium v2 overhaul)

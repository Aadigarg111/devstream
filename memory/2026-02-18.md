- DevStream project already exists from a prior session (Feb 17)
- 3 commits already pushed to GitHub (Aadigarg111/devstream)
- Daily cron job active: 9 AM IST auto-commits (cron id: f86e4063-c91f-4ff6-b228-62f0cbb55545)
- SSH auth to GitHub working

## Work Done
1. **Daily commit** — Ran the 9 AM job manually at Aadi's request

   - 4 files changed (added preview page, package-lock)

2. **GitHub OAuth** — Built full GitHub OAuth with NextAuth.js
   - Commit: `🔐 Day 2: GitHub OAuth with NextAuth.js` (58887dc)
   - 11 files, 678 lines added
   - Files: auth.ts, route.ts, SessionProvider, Navbar, login page, dashboard page, next-auth types
   - Dashboard shows: profile header, recent repos, activity feed, streak stats
   - Scopes: read:user, user:email, repo
   - Build passes clean ✅

## Pending for Aadi
- ⚠️ Still needs to verify aadileetcode@gmail.com on GitHub settings/emails (commits won't show as green squares without this)
- Needs to create GitHub OAuth App at github.com/settings/developers and put Client ID/Secret in .env.local
- Tomorrow's roadmap task: GitHub API integration - fetch user profile & contribution graph

## Aadi's Style
- Direct, short messages, mix of Hindi/English
- Wants things done, not explained at length
- IST timezone, active late night / early morning (was on at 10:30 AM IST)

## Bootstrap
- Haven't completed bootstrap yet (naming, identity setup) — Aadi jumped straight to work
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists, should revisit when Aadi has time

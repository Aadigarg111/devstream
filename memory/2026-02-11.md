## User Interaction - Aadi Garg (@Aadi_Garg, Telegram ID: 1285889265)

### Context
- First interaction with user Aadi via Telegram
- User is running OpenClaw on an AWS EC2 instance (ip-172-31-26-33)
- Public IP: 18.212.238.137

### Key Questions & Requests

**Question about persistence:**
- Asked if OpenClaw works even when VM terminal is off
- Confirmed: Yes, as long as Gateway service is running and VM is powered on
- User can close SSH/terminal sessions and I remain accessible

**Feature request:**
- Asked to add model name at the bottom of messages
- Clarified: wants to see which AI model is responding
- Need to follow up on exact preference (every message vs sometimes)

**Major project: Server Dashboard**
- User shared screenshot of desired dashboard design
- Requested: Generate full dashboard at port 3000 with real data
- Successfully built and deployed:
  - Full-stack Node.js app with Express + WebSocket
  - Real-time monitoring: CPU, Memory, Storage, Network
  - Live charts (60-sec history), process table, uptime tracking
  - Beautiful dark purple gradient UI matching reference design
  - Added model badge "🤖 Claude Sonnet 4.5" in bottom-right as requested
  - Running at: http://18.212.238.137:3000 (localhost:3000)

### Technical Details
- **Server:** AWS EC2 (Ubuntu, kernel 6.14.0-1018-aws)
- **CPU:** Intel Xeon Platinum 8259CL @ 2.50GHz
- **Memory:** 1.9GB total
- **Storage:** 29GB total (9.1GB used, 33%)
- **Network:** Interface ens5
- **Process:** openclaw-gateway running (PID 2076, 19.6% mem)

### Files Created
- `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/server-dashboard/`
  - `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
  - `server.js` - Express + WebSocket server with systeminformation
  - `public/index.html` - Dashboard UI with Chart.js

### Status
- Dashboard successfully deployed and running
- WebSocket providing real-time updates every second
- Port 3000 may need to be opened in EC2 security group for public access

### Projects Completed

**1. Server Dashboard** (port 3000)
- Real-time system monitoring with WebSocket updates
- CPU/Memory/Storage/Network metrics with live charts
- Process table, uptime tracking
- Dark purple gradient UI with model badge

**2. Train Tracker** (port 3000 - replaced server dashboard)
- Interactive train route visualization for Indian Railways
- SQLite database with ~5,209 trains imported from NTES
- Leaflet.js map with route lines, station markers
- Real-time train simulation feature (moving icon along route)
- Live scraping from NTES website (https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/)
- PM2 process manager ("train-tracker" app)
- Fixed train 22222 (NZM CSMT RAJDHANI) with official schedule
- Interactive station list with click-to-zoom
- Single solid blue route lines (no zigzags)
- Accessible at: http://18.212.238.137:3000

**3. RES1 Result Page Analysis**
- IPU result checker (Next.js project)
- Analyzed current result page structure
- User requested COMPLETE layout redesign
- Next step: Design and implement new UX/UI while keeping functionality

### Key Technical Decisions

**Train Tracker:**
- SQLite over JSON for reliability and performance
- Hybrid data: local DB first, NTES fallback
- Port 3000 (3001 was blocked by security group)
- PM2 for auto-restart and process management
- Order by time (not stop_order) to prevent zigzag routes
- 10s timeout for NTES (website frequently times out)

**GitHub:**
- User: Aadigarg111
- Email: aadileetcode@gmail.com
- SSH authenticated

### To-Do
- [ ] Complete RES1 result page redesign
- [ ] Check bulk-import.log status (may be running)
- [ ] User hasn't filled IDENTITY.md or USER.md (bootstrap pending)
